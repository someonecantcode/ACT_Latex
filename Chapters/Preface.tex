Welcome to my Accounting Guide for High school DECA.
I’ve compiled everything I’ve learned throughout my DECA career into this one document.
Feel free to change this and good luck on your DECA journey. 
Win that coveted DECA glass. 

Special Thanks to Brice Liu for guiding me 
and inspiring me do so for others.
